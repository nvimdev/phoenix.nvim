1. Phoenix                                                *guard.nvim-phoenix*

A blazing-fast asynchronous in-process server providing word and path
completion.


HOW FAST IT IS ?                         *guard.nvim-phoenix-how-fast-it-is-?*

It enables smooth word completion in nearly 10,000 lines of text and provides
instant completion in projects with thousands of files.

In the Phoenix framework, a Trie tree is used to store words, ensuring that the
completion results can be obtained in O(L) time (L is the length of the word).
Additionally, the weight of each word is calculated based on its usage
frequency and last usage time, and low-frequency words are asynchronously
cleaned up periodically to ensure that the desired results can be obtained
quickly with each input.

For path completion, Phoenix uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to handle
the results, and the completion results can be obtained in O(1) time.
Meanwhile, the cache is cleaned up based on a set time period to ensure that
the directory status is kept synchronized.

Specifically:

1. Word Completion:

- Use a Trie tree to store words, with each node representing a character.
- Each word node stores the usage frequency and last usage time of the word.
- During completion, search the Trie tree for matching words based on the input
    prefix, and return the results sorted by weight.
- Periodically clean up low-frequency words asynchronously to keep the Trie tree
    size within a reasonable range.

1. Path Completion:

- Use an LRU cache to store directory structure information, including files
    and subdirectories in the directory.
- During completion, directly look up the matching path in the cache, and obtain
    the result in O(1) time.
- Periodically sync the cache to ensure that the directory status is kept
    synchronized.
